<summary> A short story on how did I start gaming and drawing </summary>
<p>My love for gaming started when I was just 4 years old as I saw my father playing in the living room. </p>
<p>I would sit next to him and he would then pass me the controller even though I didn't know what I was doing.  </p>
<p>Later on as I grew up, my dad and I would compete against each other and we would end up fighting because one of us always cheated.  </p>
<p>As time passed he grew busy and we didn't play as much, but I continued on my own. </p>
<p>Another way my dad and I spent time together was drawing.   </p>
<p>He never took classes, it was like a gift and apparently I also had this gift.  </p>
<p>Just the same as gaming we would fight on who drew better, we choosed categories to draw and my mom would be the judge.   </p>
<p>Drawing and Gaming are the best way I pass the time, not only do I play with my dad but I also compete with my friends.  </p>
